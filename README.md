Code repository for my master’s thesis: **“Application of Semi-Supervised Learning Models for the Bioacoustic Identification of Avifauna, Herpetofauna, and Mastofauna in the Magdalena Medio Region, Colombia.”**

This work utilizes data from the **BirdCLEF 2025** challenge and builds upon the [notebooks by Kadircan İdrisoğlu](https://www.kaggle.com/kadircandrisolu) on Kaggle. The original code has been forked and modified to implement the specific **Semi-Supervised Learning architecture** proposed in this study.
